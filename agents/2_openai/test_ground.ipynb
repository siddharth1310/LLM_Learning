    "\n",
    "    ### Tool Usage Instructions\n",
    "    - **Draft Generation:** Use the following tools **exactly once each** to generate three distinct cold sales email drafts:\n",
    "    - `professional_sales_agent`\n",
    "    - `engaging_sales_agent`\n",
    "    - `busy_sales_agent`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Wait patiently until all three drafts are completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Email Selection:** Use the `sales_picker` tool **once** to evaluate the three drafts and choose the single best email. Do not modify or write any email yourself.\n",
    "    - **Email Sending:** Use the `send_email` tool **once** to send only the chosen best email. Never send more than one email.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Critical Rules\n",
    "    - Do **not** write, modify, or choose emails manually.\n",
    "    - Use the tools **in the proper sequence**: generate drafts → pick the best → send the email.\n",
    "    - Strictly adhere to calling each tool once to avoid loops or redundant operations.\n",
    "    - Upon sending the email, end the workflow without further actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Communication Style\n",
    "    - Follow these steps clearly and systematically.\n",
    "    - Avoid unnecessary commentary or explanations beyond what the tools require.\n",
    "    - Focus on correctness and efficiency of the entire process.\n",

    "\n",
    "    ### Tool Usage Instructions\n",
    "    - **Draft Generation:** Use the following tools **exactly once each** to generate three distinct cold sales email drafts:\n",
    "    - `professional_sales_agent`\n",
    "    - `engaging_sales_agent`\n",
    "    - `busy_sales_agent`\n",

    "    - **Email Selection:** Use the `sales_picker` tool **once** to evaluate the three drafts and choose the single best email. Do not modify or write any email yourself.\n",
    "    - **Email Sending:** Use the `send_email` tool **once** to send only the chosen best email. Never send more than one email.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Critical Rules\n",
    "    - Do **not** write, modify, or choose emails manually.\n",
    "    - Use the tools **in the proper sequence**: generate drafts → pick the best → send the email.\n",
    "    - Strictly adhere to calling each tool once to avoid loops or redundant operations.\n",
    "    - Upon sending the email, end the workflow without further actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Communication Style\n",
    "    - Follow these steps clearly and systematically.\n",
    "    - Avoid unnecessary commentary or explanations beyond what the tools require.\n",

    "    - Likely to encourage the recipient to open the email,\n",
    "    - Clear and concise, ideally under 60 characters.\n",

    "    3. Next, call the `html_converter` tool to transform the text email body into a clean and well-formatted HTML version.\n",
    "    4. Finally, call the `send_html_email` tool with the subject and the HTML body to send out the email.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Important notes:\n",
    "    - You must strictly follow this order: subject generation → HTML conversion → sending.\n",
    "    - Do not alter the email content manually; use the provided tools for each step.\n",
    "    - Confirm that each step completes successfully before moving on to the next.\n",

    "    - **Draft Generation:** Use the following tools **exactly once each** to generate three distinct cold sales email drafts:\n",

    "    - `engaging_sales_agent`\n",
    "    - `busy_sales_agent`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Wait patiently until all three drafts are completed.\n",

    "    - **Email Selection:** Use the `sales_picker` tool **once** to evaluate the three drafts and choose the single best email. Do not modify or write any email yourself.\n",
    "    - **Email Sending:** Use the `send_email` tool **once** to send only the chosen best email. Never send more than one email.\n",

    "    ### Critical Rules\n",
    "    - Do **not** write, modify, or choose emails manually.\n",
    "    - Use the tools **in the proper sequence**: generate drafts → pick the best → send the email.\n",
    "    - Strictly adhere to calling each tool once to avoid loops or redundant operations.\n",
    "    - Upon sending the email, end the workflow without further actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Communication Style\n",
    "    - Follow these steps clearly and systematically.\n",
    "    - Avoid unnecessary commentary or explanations beyond what the tools require.\n",

    "    - Likely to encourage the recipient to open the email,\n",
    "    - Clear and concise, ideally under 60 characters.\n",

    "    ### Important notes:\n",
    "    - Focus on professionalism and relevance to SOC2 compliance and audit preparation.\n",

    "    4. Finally, call the `send_html_email` tool with the subject and the HTML body to send out the email.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Important notes:\n",
    "    - You must strictly follow this order: subject generation → HTML conversion → sending.\n",
    "    - Do not alter the email content manually; use the provided tools for each step.\n",
