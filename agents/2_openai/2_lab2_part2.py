    Creates an Agent instance with a specific role and associated OpenAI client.

    <b>*Parameters*</b>
    - name (str): The descriptive name used to identify the agent (e.g., "Professional Sales Agent").
    - instructions (str): The prompt or instructions that specify the agent's personality and behavior.
    - client: The initialized AsyncOpenAI client for model communication.

    <b>*Returns*</b>
    - Agent: An agent object set up with the given instructions and client, ready to generate responses.

    <b>*Logic*</b>
    1. Configure an Agent object with a name and personalized instructions.
    2. Bind the OpenAI chat model ('gpt-4o-mini') and provide the API client for requests.
    3. Return the configured agent for further interaction.

    <b>*Returns*</b>
    - None (prints output directly to the terminal/console).

    1. Securely fetch the OpenAI API key from environment variables.

    5. Simultaneously run each sales agent to generate different cold email variants.
    6. Collect and format these emails into a single prompt for the picker agent.
    7. Run the picker agent in streamed mode to select the best email, handling output as it arrives.
    8. Manage and report any errors that occur during API calls or execution.
